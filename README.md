## Overview

This is a TypeScript + ReactJS app, using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) to compile and bundle assets.

The long term goal is for it to replace the old and unmaintained dashboard that is built into [`kegbot-server`](https://github.com/kegbot/kegbot-server). A shorter-term goal is make it more fun and easier for frontend developers to contribute to that frontend!

Currently, the frontend only runs from a developer environment. It will eventually be bundled into `kegbot-server` when it is ready.

## Developer instructions

### Initial setup

Install the various javascript dependencies:

```
$yarn install
```

### Running the development server

Run this command while hacking on the frontend:

```
yarn start
```

This command will:

* Activate `parcel` and start watching source
* Launch a hot-reloading devserver on `http://localhost:1234`
* Run a proxy to `http://localhost:8008/` for accessing the `kegbot-server` (backend)

### Rebuild `README.md` TOC

```
yarn toc
```
